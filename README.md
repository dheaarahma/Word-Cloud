What are Word Clouds?

A word cloud is a form of visual representation. It is a grouping of words that are displayed in various sizes: the larger and bolder the term, the more frequently it appears in a document and the more important it is. 
Text clouds include data visualization, text data, font colours, word frequency analysis, and specific word graphics. These are ideal techniques to extract the most relevant sections of textual material, from blog posts to databases, and are also known as tag clouds or text clouds. They can also assist business users in comparing and contrasting two separate pieces of text in order to identify phrasing similarities.
